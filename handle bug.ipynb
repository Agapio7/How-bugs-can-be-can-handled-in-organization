        "It is impossible to make perfect product. There are many bugs  we found in  our software . We encounter several errors such as **Functional errors, Performance defects, Usability defects, Compatibility defects, Security defects, Syntax errors, Logic errors, Unit-level bugs, System-level integration bugs, Code Duplication and Data Type Mismatch** in software development lifecycle. The Tricentis, an Australian software company has reported that software failures cost the worldwide economy over $1 trillion annually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debugs are an inseparable part of every software and products which cause risk to financial and reputation loss and customers. Despite, we can minimize the effects of errors through various methods and strategies. Some of them are as follows\n",
        "\n",
        "* We need to **prioritize defects** based upon emergency. Most bugs should be solved urgently and other can be solve within time. Software teams should use benchmarks to estimate how many bugs the team can fix in a month. Development teams should prioritize bugs and handle them correctly when such unmanaged bugs and can have adverse effects on the software apps.\n",
        " \n",
        "* **Severity** is next aspects for managing errors. It defines the impact of a given bug on the application. So, the company should also calculate the burden of errors in their software.\n",
        " \n",
        "* Thirdly, bugs should be **categorized** well. That stands for creating databases and more accurate reports so that testers can check whether a given error has already been reported or not. Applications that are creating most problem has to be identified, solved and given attention. Defect risk can be measured based on critical, high, medium and low risk.\n",
        " \n",
        "* A **good defect management tool** should be used to encompasses a record of detected bugs, allows users to report bugs and make feature requests directly on their apps. This software prioritizes bugs and assign issues respectively as well. Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine, Mantis and Backlog are most commonly used bug tracking tools. Jira can be used to track all kinds of bugs and issues more related to the software and generated by the test engineer. Similarly, MantisBT is used to follow the software defects whereas backlog is commonly used to manage the IT projects and track the bugs.\n",
        " \n",
        "* First, we should **focus on making the code** and its dependencies easy to run locally using the 12-factor app methodology such as code base dependencies, configuration, backing services, build, release, run processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability, parity, logs and admin processes. After that, we can make the deployment process automatic and easy, and keep deployments small.\n",
