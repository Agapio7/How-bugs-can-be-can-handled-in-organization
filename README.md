# How bugs can be handles in organization ?

Fig 1: [Bug in software](https://https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginner-bug-squashing-guide/)

It is impossible to make perfect product. There are many bugs  we found in  our software . We encounter several errors such as **Functional errors, Performance defects, Usability defects, Compatibility defects, Security defects, Syntax errors, Logic errors, Unit-level bugs, System-level integration bugs, Code Duplication and Data Type Mismatch** in software development lifecycle. The Tricentis, an Australian software company has reported that software failures cost the worldwide economy over $1 trillion annually.

Debugs are an inseparable part of every software and products which cause risk to financial and reputation loss and customers. Despite, we can minimize the effects of errors through various methods and strategies. Some of them are as follows

* We need to **prioritize defects** based upon emergency. Most bugs should be solved urgently and other can be solve within time. Software teams should use benchmarks to estimate how many bugs the team can fix in a month. Development teams should prioritize bugs and handle them correctly when such unmanaged bugs and can have adverse effects on the software apps.
 
* **Severity** is next aspects for managing errors. It defines the impact of a given bug on the application. So, the company should also calculate the burden of errors in their software.
 
* Thirdly, bugs should be **categorized** well. That stands for creating databases and more accurate reports so that testers can check whether a given error has already been reported or not. Applications that are creating most problem has to be identified, solved and given attention. Defect risk can be measured based on critical, high, medium and low risk.
 
* A **good defect management tool** should be used to encompasses a record of detected bugs, allows users to report bugs and make feature requests directly on their apps. This software prioritizes bugs and assign issues respectively as well. Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine, Mantis and Backlog are most commonly used bug tracking tools. Jira can be used to track all kinds of bugs and issues more related to the software and generated by the test engineer. Similarly, MantisBT is used to follow the software defects whereas backlog is commonly used to manage the IT projects and track the bugs.
 
* First, we should **focus on making the code** and its dependencies easy to run locally using the 12-factor app methodology such as code base dependencies, configuration, backing services, build, release, run processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability, parity, logs and admin processes. After that, we can make the deployment process automatic and easy, and keep deployments small.

  ## How developers handle bugging?
                                                    
*  **Create Testable Code** so that you can reduce the number of bugs that could have appeared further down the line.
*  Complex code is chances to have bug issue. **Use concise, smaller code** commits that are readable, clearer and easier to unit test.
*  **Splitting up your code** into independent modules into separate files so that you can test each piece of code independently.  As a consequence, this will make developer code less complicated and more straightforward to test.
*  Have a positive **response towards compiler warnings**. These warnings   may lead to bugs in your code.
*  **Testing and testing** at multiple stages in pipeline helps to find bugs in early stage and solve them more easily than final stages of development.
*  **Keep patience and take time** to follow best methods to avoid time and money and Practice Coding Standards to standardize code development and provide a clear path to approach issue.
*   **Use existing libraries** to save you time and reduce the risk of bugs.
*   **Use Rubber Ducky Testing** to make your code is clear and easy for any developer to understand.
*   Develop a **mindset of priority** to quality code that will support your development team and bug issue.

 **Developer tasks in brief**
 
* From inside outwards - focus on code
* Assertions - verify data flow and structures
* Debugger - verify code flow and data
* Unit testing - verify each function
* Integration testing - verify sub-systems
* System testing - verify functionality


## Role of tester in handling bug?

Tester plays vital role to conduct both manual and automated tests of software products. Wrong coding, missing coding and extra coding are responsible for occurrence of bug in software testing. Following are the tasks performed by tester in solving bug.

* Testers **implement many bug tracking tools** available in software testing to track the bug related to the software or the application. Testers uses Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine, Mantis and Backlog for bug tracking.

* Testers needs to be **diplomatic and patient** to convince a developer about a defect they found. When a tester issue one bug, the developer will come with many justifications. At the same time, Developers need support from the testing team to make a better software. An open and friendly way will always support the tester know the programmer well.
* Having a **good documentation and presentation** of report is crucial for tester to record and report a problem.
* Testers should design his/her bug reports and test documents in such a way that can clearly lays out the risks and seriousness of issues.
* It’s better for testers to **conduct a meeting, explain and convince** the issues to the developers’ teams. Testers should balance listening and implementation skills.
 
**Tester roles in brief**

* From outside in - focus on features
* Scenarios - verify real-world situations
* Global tests - verify feasible inputs
* Regression tests - verify defects stay fixed
* Code coverage - testing untouched code
* Compatibility - with previous releases
* Looking for quirks and rough edges

## Role of Senior managers to handle bug?

* Senior executive should possess **genuine commitment** to fulfill customer issues.
* Mangers **ensure that employees understand** what’s at stake how employee performance affects the customer and the business.
* Managers should **engage employees in customer solutions** to make customer issue an integral part of their routine.
* Developing **open communication channels** is important within organization. Frontline employees should  be given access for easy-to-use processes for capturing and communicating customer insights.
